# goodkids: Tastyworks Utilities on API Endpoints (Unofficial)

## Overview

This repository is a series of lean and simple utilities based on the Tastyworks
endpoints. The utilities include mostly tools to fetch and incrementally update
the transactions log of your account to a local database and fetch other states
of your account, such as balances, net-liq, a list of positions (for
monitoring), and more.

This is not suitable for trading and does not include any order placement
capabilities.
