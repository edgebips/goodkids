"""Get the list of transactions for a single TW account.

Running this script with `database-filename` and `account-pattern` will
incrementally update a local dbm/Python shelve mapping of unique transaction-id
to JSON/dict data for that account. You can access it with a shelve. Example:

    tastyworks-update transactions.db Margin

Notes:

* The script will automatically avoid fetching again old data.
* It will start at the beginning of the account time creation.
* You can just run this regularly to build a local database of all your
  transactions log.

NOTE: Your username and/or password is not stored anywhere. The session token,
however, is cached and reused as much as possible; where needed, your username
and password can be provided in one of three ways:

- As command-line arguments (--username, --password). Note that this makes them
  visible to procinfo for the root user while the script is running.

- As environment variables (`TW_USER` / `TW_PASSWORD`). Note that this makes
  them visible for the root while the program is running as it is possible
  inspect the environment of any process.

- If not provided, you will be queried on the command-line for their values,
  only when needed. The password is hidden from the console. But you have to
  type it in each time it is needed.
